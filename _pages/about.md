# Biography

Currently, I am working at the Shanghai AI lab as a Research Fellow. I got a Ph.D. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and was supervised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/#). Before that, I received my B.Sc. degree from Northeastern University.

# Research Interests
My research interests include topics in the explainability and safety of multi-modal foundation models. **We are looking for cooperation and research interns to work together on the safety/robustness/explainability of foundation models. Please drop me an email liudongrui@pjlab.org.cn if you are interested.**
