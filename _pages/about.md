# Biography
I am pursuing my Ph.D degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am now internshipping in the lab of Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/#) at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to SJTU, I have received my Bachelor degree from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/) of [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

# Research Interests
My research interests include topics in machine learning and computer vision.
Most recently, I am interested in Explainable deep learning and 3D point cloud processing. If you are interested in my works, please feel free to drop me an email through drliu96@sjtu.edu.cn.
